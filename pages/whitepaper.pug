                    p The growing trend towards the centralization of online tools has severe privacy and security implications. The underlying networks create a single point of failure, hackers have it easier to get to valuable and sensitive data, and network providers can be bullied by local governmental agencies to disclose sensitive information about their clients and users.
                    p We are living in the post-Snowden and Wikileaks era. We know there is a substantial need to protect privacy in online communication. And things might only be beginning. The emergence of the ‘Internet of Things’ (IOT), heralds a new age in the era of mass surveillance. TV’s that record bedroom conversations, phones and tablets tracking your every move, and even smart glassware that keeps track of what you’re drinking.  Furthermore, we like this stuff and the many benefits it brings.  We're simply not okay with the reality that under the current technological paradigm, it's impossible to be sure if our conversations are secure.  We aim to solve that, preserving the pace of innovation for all people, while protecting their privacy.

                    p This is where the case for decentralization begins in our eyes. At the moment, we are forced to  trust organizations in order to use the internet in the “normal” way. We trust banks keep our funds secure. We trust cloud storage services to keep our documents and data available and private. And we trust social networks to only show our pictures to the people we want. All of this requires a high level of trust in these organizations. Yet, we have no control or even information on these organizations. There is no guarantee that they won’t change their mind on privacy decisions, go completely out of business, or be acquired by a company with different views on privacy.  Further, there is abundant evidence that we should NOT trust these organizations:
